# Ultima Gym

## Purpose of Ultima Gym

The Ultima Gym website is a landing page for fitness enthusiasts in the Basingstoke area of Hampshire, England who are looking for a gym in which they are supported by the best equipment available and a team of personal trainers to achieve their fitness goals.

The website has an introduction stating the goals of Ultima Gym (helping people realise their fitness goals), two further sections explaining how those goals are achieved (through state-of-the-art equipment/ facilities and an on-hand personal training team), and a section with information about meeting times, prices, telephone numbers and a sign up form. The website also features a footer section with links to social media and an address of the Ultima Gym facility.

All of this information is useful for anyone looking to sign up at a gym like Ultima Gym and it is all displayed on one page in clearly defined and easily navigable sections so the user will be able to easily find what information they want.

## Features

* The Logo and Navigation Bar
    * The Logo and Navigation Bar is fixed to the top of the screen of the website and follows the user throughout their navigation of the main page. This is so the user is never more than one click away from a part of the website they wish to visit.
    * The Logo and Navigation Bar contains four links: Ultima Gym, Home, Services and Contact. These links highlight upon being hovered over.
    * The Ultima Gym link resides on the left of the Navigation Bar on larger screen sizes and above the others on smaller screen sizes. It contains a link to the index.html file (the main website page) which essentially just refreshes the main page and brings you back to the top.
    * The Home link is an internal link which brings you back to the top of the page without refreshing as the Ultima Gym link does. It is found on the right of the navigation bar on larger screen sizes and below the Ultima Gym link on smaller screen sizes. This means the animation on the hero image will not play again if this link is clicked.
    * The Services link is an internal link which takes you to the services section of the website where it is explained how Ultima Gym works to ensure that clients are able to achieve their fitness goals. It is found on the right of the navigation bar on larger screen sizes and below the Ultima Gym link on smaller screen sizes.
    * The Contact link is an internal link which takes you to the contact section of the website where the sign-up form, opening times table, prices table and telephone number can be found. It is found on the right of the navigation bar on larger screen sizes and below the Ultima Gym link on smaller screen sizes. Directly below the contact section is the footer with social media links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and a drop down summary showing the address of Ultima Gym.
    * The Logo and Navigation Bar has a background of dark grey and text in white for good color contrast. When a link is hovered over, it turns orange indicating it is clickable whilst still maintaining a contrast with the dark background.

* The Hero Image and Welcome Message
    * The Hero Image and Welcome Message show an image of a man running on a treadmill and an orange background/ white text text container displaying the words "Welcome to a New Kind of Gym". 
    * The Hero Image has an animation play to slightly zoom in on the image to give the impression of movement which is fitting for a website about fitness.
    * The Welcome Message and the Hero Image are changed significantly on smaller screen sizes to not affect the layout of the website too much by taking up too much space. The welcome message is hidden at smaller screen sizes and the eventually decreases in size on smaller screen sizes.

* The Our Mission Section
    * The Our Mission Section is split into two: a paragraph of text explaining the purpose of Ultima Gym and an image of a woman doing pushups. On larger screen sizes this displays as the paragraph being on the left hand side of the screen and the image being on the right hand side; on smaller screen sizes the display is block-style with the paragraph coming first and the then the image of the woman doing pushups below it.
    * This section is purely for introductory purposes for the user of the website.
    * The Heading of the paragraph is in dark grey to contrast with the orange background and the paragraph text is in white for the same reason. The image of the woman doing pushups is dark for contrast reasons and similarly all images on the website are dark for the same reasons.

* The Services Section Banner
    * The Services Section Banner introduces the Services Section of the website. It features an orange background and a heading in dark grey and underlined for contrast purposes and to inform the user of the section they are entering if they are scrolling through the website.

* The Our Facilities Section
    * The Our Facilities Section is similar to the Our Mission Section in layout on larger screen sizes except its image and paragraph sections are reversed so that there is room to 'breath' for both paragraphs and images on the webpage.
    * The paragraph section has the same colors as the Our Mission Section and features information on the facilities at Ultima Gym.
    * The image section features an image of a barbell with weights on it and is again darkly colored for contrast purposes.
    * Next to the heading are featured Font Awesome icons in the text which display little pictures of dumbbells to further emphasise the section heading.

* The Our Personal Training Team Section
    * The Our Personal Training Team Section is similar to the Our Mission and Our Facilities Sections in layout on larger screens but again switches the paragraph and images sections so has the same layout as the Our Mission Section.
    * Again the colors are the same as the Our Mission and Our Facilities Section for the same reasons.
    * The image section shows an image of a woman pressing two dumbbells with a personal trainer assisting thus reinforcing the purpose of the section to the user.
    * Next to the heading are featured Font Awesome icons in the text which display little pictures of groups of people to further emphasise the section heading.

* The Contact Section Banner and the Contact Intro
    * The Contact Section Banner is similar to the Services Section Banner in its appearance except underneath it is the Contact Intro in this case.
    * The Contact Intro introduces the user to the Contact Section, displaying white text on an orange background and asking them to contact Ultima Gym either by phone or by completing the sign-up form below.
    * The Contact Section consists of three separate areas (Sign-up Form, Opening Times Table and Prices Table), for larger screen sizes they are arranged horizontally but for smaller screen sizes they are displayed vertically one after another so they fit the screen.

* The Sign-up Form
    * The Sign-up Form consists of a form where the user can submit their details (First Name, Last Name, email address, optional phone number and a checkbox stating whether they are over 18 years old).
    * The Sign-up Form acts as a way for the user to contact Ultima Gym to let them know they are interested and gives the staff of Ultima Gym the ability to contact the user through email or potentially via a text if the user has submitted their phone number.
    * The Sign-up Form links to the form-submission.html page once the relevant fields have been filled in properly. If they haven't the form will notify the user and will not be submitted.

* The Opening Times Table and the Prices Table
    * These tables make up the rest of the Contact Section and consist of two tables that display information on the opening times and prices of Ultima Gym.
    * The text of the tables is centered to make it more easily readable.

* The Footer, the Address and the Social Media Links
    * The Footer consists of four div elements on top of eachother displaying the address of Ultima Gym and links to Ultima Gym social media.
    * It follows the same color scheme as the Logo and Navigation Bar and the clickable social media links turn orange when hovered over as well.
    * The Address can be clicked on to drop down to display Ultima Gym's Address. This drop-down means it only takes up space on the user's screen when they want it to.
    * The social media links have Font Awesome icons displaying the relevant social media icons which can be clicked on to take you to the relevant social media website.

* The Form Submission Page
    * The Form Submission Page is a very basic page using the color scheme from the main website. There is only one option here which is to click the highlighted and underlined link back to the main page.
    * The purpose of this page is to make sure that the user knows they have submitted their information to Ultima Gym.

## Future Features

* Resizable Images
    * I would like to make a feature where the images more resizable depending on screen size.

* Change to Logo and Navigation Bars
    * I would like a feature where on small screen sizes the Logo is replaced by a symbol and the navigation bar is replaced with a drop down menu making it easier for mobile users.

## Typography and Color Scheme

* Color Scheme
    * The color scheme used in my website was designed to be contrasting and therefore accessible for the visually impaired. I generated multiple color schemes on the http://colormind.io/ website before deciding on one that fit the Ultima Gym website. Colormind is a deep learning tool which generates color schemes.
    * The hex values of the colors used in my website are: 
        *#ffffff for the white color
        *#f26e31 for the orange color
        *#ab9a99 for the light grey background color
        *#3d2e30 for the dark grey color
    * These colors when contrasted look both clean and energetic; ideal for a website advertising a gym.

* Font Pairings
    * During research for the website, I read the article at https://www.pagecloud.com/blog/best-google-fonts-pairings and decided to use the pairing of PT Sans for paragraph text and Nunito as heading text as I thought the combination looked clean and modern.
    * These fonts were taken from https://fonts.google.com/ .

* Font Awesome Icons
    * For the Our Services, Our Personal Training Team and the social media links icons were taken from https://fontawesome.com/ .
