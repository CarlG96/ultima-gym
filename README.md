# Ultima Gym

## Purpose of Ultima Gym

The Ultima Gym website is a landing page for fitness enthusiasts in the Basingstoke area of Hampshire, England who are looking for a gym in which they are supported by the best equipment available and a team of personal trainers to achieve their fitness goals.

The website has an introduction stating the goals of Ultima Gym (helping people realise their fitness goals), two further sections explaining how those goals are achieved (through state-of-the-art equipment/ facilities and an on-hand personal training team), and a section with information about meeting times, prices, telephone numbers and a sign up form. The website also features a footer section with links to social media and an address of the Ultima Gym facility.

## User Stories

## Features

* The Logo and Navigation Bar
    * The Logo and Navigation Bar is fixed to the top of the screen of the website and follows the user throughout their navigation of the main page. This is so the user is never more than one click away from a part of the website they wish to visit.
    * The Logo and Navigation Bar contains four links: Ultima Gym, Home, Services and Contact. These links highlight upon being hovered over.
    * The Ultima Gym link resides on the left of the Navigation Bar on larger screen sizes and above the others on smaller screen sizes. It contains a link to the index.html file (the main website page) which essentially just refreshes the main page and brings you back to the top.
    * The Home link is an internal link which brings you back to the top of the page without refreshing as the Ultima Gym link does. It is found on the right of the navigation bar on larger screen sizes and below the Ultima Gym link on smaller screen sizes. This means the animation on the hero image will not play again if this link is clicked.
    * The Services link is an internal link which takes you to the services section of the website where it is explained how Ultima Gym works to ensure that clients are able to achieve their fitness goals. It is found on the right of the navigation bar on larger screen sizes and below the Ultima Gym link on smaller screen sizes.
    * The Contact link is an internal link which takes you to the contact section of the website where the sign-up form, opening times table, prices table and telephone number can be found. It is found on the right of the navigation bar on larger screen sizes and below the Ultima Gym link on smaller screen sizes. Directly below the contact section is the footer with social media links to Facebook, Twitter and Instagram and a drop down summary showing the address of Ultima Gym.
    * The Logo and Navigation Bar has a background of dark grey and text in white for good color contrast. When a link is hovered over, it turns orange indicating it is clickable whilst still maintaining a contrast with the dark background.

* The Hero Image and Welcome Message
    * The Hero Image and Welcome Message show an image of a man running on a treadmill and an orange background/ white text text container displaying the words "Welcome to a New Kind of Gym". 
    * The Hero Image has an animation play to slightly zoom in on the image to give the impression of movement which is fitting for a website about fitness.
    * The Welcome Message and the Hero Image are changed significantly on smaller screen sizes to not affect the layout of the website too much by taking up too much space. The welcome message is hidden at smaller screen sizes and the eventually decreases in size on smaller screen sizes.

* The Our Mission Section
    * The Our Mission Section is split into two: a paragraph of text explaining the purpose of Ultima Gym and an image of a woman doing pushups. On larger screen sizes this displays as the paragraph being on the left hand side of the screen and the image being on the right hand side; on smaller screen sizes the display is block-style with the paragraph coming first and the then the image of the woman doing pushups below it.
    * This section is purely for introductory purposes for the user of the website.
    * The Heading of the paragraph is in dark grey to contrast with the orange background and the paragraph text is in white for the same reason. The image of the woman doing pushups is dark for contrast reasons and similarly all images on the website are dark for the same reasons.

* The Services Section Banner
    * The Services Section Banner introduces the Services Section of the website. It features an orange background and a heading in dark grey and underlined for contrast purposes and to inform the user of the section they are entering if they are scrolling through the website.

* The Our Facilities Section
    * The Our Facilities Section is similar to the Our Mission Section in layout on larger screen sizes except its image and paragraph sections are reversed so that there is room to 'breath' for both paragraphs and images on the webpage.
    * The paragraph section has the same colors as the Our Mission Section and features information on the facilities at Ultima Gym.
    * The image section features an image of a barbell with weights on it and is again darkly colored for contrast purposes.
    * Next to the heading are featured Font Awesome icons in the text which display little pictures of dumbbells to further emphasise the section heading.

* The Our Personal Training Team Section
    * The Our Personal Training Team Section is similar to the Our Mission and Our Facilities Sections in layout on larger screens but again switches the paragraph and images sections so has the same layout as the Our Mission Section.
    * Again the colors are the same as the Our Mission and Our Facilities Section for the same reasons.
    * The image section shows an image of a woman pressing two dumbbells with a personal trainer assisting thus reinforcing the purpose of the section to the user.
    * Next to the heading are featured Font Awesome icons in the text which display little pictures of groups of people to further emphasise the section heading.

* The Contact Section Banner and the Contact Intro
    * The Contact Section Banner is similar to the Services Section Banner in its appearance except underneath it is the Contact Intro in this case.
    * The Contact Intro introduces the user to the Contact Section, displaying white text on an orange background and asking them to contact Ultima Gym either by phone or by completing the sign-up form below.
